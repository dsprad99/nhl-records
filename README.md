# nhl-records
#This project was in an attempt to learn more about scraping data from CSV files and putting them in a dataset
#With this dataset I was able to break it off into other datasets to easily and effectively orangize my data so I could make comarisons
#The overall goals of this was to try and see how well the Carolina Hurricanes performed at home versus away
#To do this I would check to see whether the string Carolina Hurricanes was in the home or visitor column
#If Carolina Hurricanes was in the visitor column I would compare integer values in the home goals scored versus visitors goals scored column
#If it was greater in the visitor columm then it would be counted as a Carolina Hurricanes Visitor Win. If not it would be counted as a Carolina Hurricanes Visitor Loss
#This applied the same for when the Carolina Hurricanes were in the home column
